app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true
})); // set application/x-www-form-urlencoded as middleware

WHAT IS A X-WWW-FORM-URLENCODED AND HOW DOES IT GET PARSED?
- I understand that bodyparser.urlencoded... returns a function.
- app.use(function...) basically makes everything going through the file get 'checked' by the function
